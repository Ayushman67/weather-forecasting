# weather-prediction

The activities of many primary sectors depend on the weather for production, e.g. farming. The
climate is changing at a drastic rate nowadays, which makes the old weather prediction methods less
effective and more hectic.
To overcome these difficulties, the improved and reliable weather prediction methods are required.
These predictions affect a nation’s economy and the lives of people. To develop a weather prediction
system that can be used in remote areas is the main motivation of this work. A low-cost and portable
solution for weather prediction is devised.

ALGORITHM:
The data which is received from the satellite is in RAW format which doesn’t provide any kind of
information.
➢ The process of converting RAW data into the cleaned data is known as Knowledge Discovery Process
(Data Mining). Various method of data mining is used,
• Rule-based Methods
• Neural Networks
• Naive Bayes
• Bayesian Belief Network
• Support Vector Machine

PROPOSED TOOLS:
➢ Source: Kaggle datasets
➢ Packages: NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, Scikit, Matplotlib
➢ IDE: Visual Studio / Google Colab
